- Earned my MA in **Applied Statistics** from Yonsei University (supervised by the amazing Sangun Park) and my Bachelor of Economics from Cornell University. 

- I enjoy **visualizing data** â€” check out my projects. In the past several years I've become an experienced Tableau and Power BI user.

- I love **working out**, baking, eating good food, and meeting new people :)

- The **projects** page is a nice place to see some of my work, but you can also view my resume.
