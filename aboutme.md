My name is Inigo Montoya. I have the following qualities:

- I rock a great mustache
- I'm extremely loyal to my family

### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.

Currently a **MS in Business Analytics student** at UT Dallas. Previously worked as a **consultant** (Deloitte) for 5 years and did internship in investment banks (JP Morgan, Nomura, Woori Investment & Securities).

Obtained my MA in **Applied Statistics** from Yonsei University (supervised by the amazing Sangun Park) and my Bachelor of Economics from Cornell University. My masters thesis project involved developing computational methods to automatically analyze droplet digital PCR data.

The **projects** page is a nice place to see some of my work, but you can also view my resume.

Grew up in _Seoul, Korea_; moved to _Ithaca, NY_ for college; worked in _Seoul, Korea_ after undergrad; crossed the border again to _Dallas, TX_ for grad school.
