You can email me or find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eslizchoi) if you want to get in touch. As I said, I love meeting new people so don't hesitate to send a message!

My full-time job is consulting work in R and Shiny, so feel free to get in touch if you want to discuss potential projects, your Shiny needs, or need any paid help.
